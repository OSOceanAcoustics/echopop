# README

Matlab EchoPro code. This version corresponds to the code present in the zip file `UW_EchoProMatlab_Repackaged.zip` in the Google Drive folder "UW_EchoProMatlab_Repackaged", as of January 6, 2022. More specifically, it corresponds to the content of the `EchoPro` folder in that zip file, except that the following files have been removed:

- All input and output data files
- Much of the content in `m_map1.4` (the map plotting toolbox)  that stores the geographical data used in the maps. Only the m scripts in the base level folder are retained
- Excel files under `input_files`
- All subfolders under `other_programs` and all Excel and other data files at the root level. These are not expected to be used directly in EchoPro. We'll add back individual m-script files as needed
