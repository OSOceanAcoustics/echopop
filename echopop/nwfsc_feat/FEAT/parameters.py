    Generate region-specific transect boundaries for the 1998 NWFSC survey.

    This function defines the spatial boundaries for three distinct survey regions used in the
    1998 Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) survey. Each region has specific transect
    numbering schemes and boundary definitions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    region : np.number
        Region identifier (1, 2, or 3):
        - Region 1: Parallel transects to latitudes from south of SCB to west of Haida Gwaii
        - Region 2: Transects parallel to longitudes north of Haida Gwaii
        - Region 3: Parallel transects to latitudes west of Haida Gwaii

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[np.number, np.number, List[np.number], List[np.number]]
        A tuple containing:
        - transect_start (np.number): Starting transect number for the region
        - transect_end (np.number): Ending transect number for the region
        - transect_lower_bound (List[np.number]): Lower boundary values for each transect
        - transect_upper_bound (List[np.number]): Upper boundary values for each transect

    Examples
    --------
    >>> start, end, lower, upper = transect_mesh_region_2019(1)
    >>> print(f"Region 1: transects {start} to {end}")
    Region 1: transects 1 to 119
    >>> print(f"Lower bounds: {lower[:3]}")  # First 3 values
    Lower bounds: [1.1, 2.1, 3.1]

    Notes
    -----
    The boundary values are encoded with decimal places that indicate spatial positions:
    - .1 indicates western boundary (for regions 1 and 3)
    - .4 indicates eastern boundary (for regions 1 and 3)
    - .6 indicates southern boundary (for region 2)
    - .9 indicates northern boundary (for region 2)
