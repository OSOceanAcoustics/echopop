## Statistics
| Symbol | Definition | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| $\text{Cov}$, $\mathbb{C}$ | covariance |  | Units are the product of the units of the two variables (e.g., m·s)  |
| $\text{CV}$ | coeffficient of variance |  |  |
| $\mathbb{E}$ | expected value |  | Units are the same as the variable's units |
| $\gamma$ | semivariance |  | Units are the square of the variable's units (e.g., m²); <br> often denoted as $\gamma(h)$ for lag distance $h$ |
| $\text{KS}$ test | Kolmogorov-Smirnov test | |  |
| $\mathbb{R}$ | real value |  |  |
| $\theta$ | set of parameters |  |  |
| $\mathbb{V}$, $\sigma^2$ | variance |  | Units are the square of the variable's units (e.g., m²) |  |
| $Z$ | random field or spatial process|  |  |

## Survey
| Symbol | Definition | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| $A$ | area | km<sup>2</sup> or nmi<sup>2</sup> |  |
| $d$ | distance | km or nmi |  |
| $g$ | haul/trawl | |  |
| $i$ | stratum | |  |
| $\text{INPFC}$ | International North Pacific Fisheries Commission | | Used interchangeably to denote <br> latitude-based stratification |
| $k$ | along-transect interval | | Sometimes also referred to as the elementary <br> distance sampling unit, or $\textit{EDSU}$ |
| $t$ | transect | | |
| $x, y$ | geospatial location |  | Units can be $\degree$ in the case of longitude and latitude,<br> or something else depending on how data are <br> georeferenced or projected |
