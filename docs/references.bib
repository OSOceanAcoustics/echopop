	abstract = {Data derived with a 38-kHz split-beam echo sounder have been analyzed to yield target strengths suitable for use with echo integrators. This has required compensation for both thresholding and saturation, since these operations can significantly bias data intended for use with systems, such as echo integrators, whose dynamic ranges are much larger. A nonparametric statistical method is introduced for this purpose. Pure-species acoustic data are extracted in several two-species cases by a method for separating superimposed frequency distributions. Mean in situ target strengths are presented for cod, saithe, Norway pout, herring, redfish, and greater silver smelt. For com- parison with other data, these are expressed through the standard equation ∼(TS) =20 log l +b, where ∼(TS) is the mean target strength in decibels, and l is the fish length in centimeters. For gadoids of lengths from 10 to over 105 cm, b=−67.5 dB. For herring of lengths from 24 to 34 cm, b=−72.1 dB. The often-ignored problem of obtaining unambiguous biological data by trawl sampling is discussed.},

            This text fulfils a need for an advanced-level work covering both the theory and application of geostatistics. It covers the most important areas of geostatistical methodology, introducing tools for description, quantitative modelling of spatial continuity, spatial prediction, and assessment of local uncertainty and stochastic simulation. It also details the theoretical background underlying most GSLIB programs. The tools are applied to an environmental data set, but the book includes a general presentation of algorithms intended for students and practitioners in such diverse fields as soil science, mining, petroleum, remote sensing, hydrogeology, and the environmental sciences.},
