# EchoPro documentation and example notebooks

This site currently hosts example Jupyter notebooks for the new Python EchoPro package (https://github.com/uw-echospace/EchoPro/) (But note that the repository is private and only previously approved users can access it). Over time, the documentation for this package will be added here too.

The Jupyter notebooks are shown in a "rendered", executed form.

```{admonition} Glitches with some interactive graphical elements
While the notebooks in this site are rendered, there are some glitches we're still working out. In particular, an [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) interactive graphical element in the semivariogram widget doesn't display correctly.
```

Go to the individual example notebooks below or in the table of content on the left.

## Installation

See the [README.md](https://github.com/uw-echospace/EchoPro/blob/master/README.md) in the EchoPro repository for installation and execution instructions.
