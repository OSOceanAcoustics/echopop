# Echopop

This site currently hosts example Jupyter notebooks for the Echopop package (https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopop/). Over time, the documentation for this package will be added here too.

The Jupyter notebooks are shown in a "rendered", executed form.

```{admonition} Glitches with some interactive graphical elements
While the notebooks in this site are rendered, there are some glitches in the display we're still working out. In particular, an [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) interactive graphical element in the semivariogram widget doesn't display correctly. The notebooks do run correctly when executed with Jupyter Notebook ("classic", not JupyterLab).
```

Go to the individual example notebooks below or in the table of content on the left.

## Installation

See the [README.md](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopop/blob/master/README.md) in the Echopop repository for installation and execution instructions.
