# EchoPro documentation and example notebooks

This site currently hosts example Jupyter notebooks for the new Python EchoPro package (https://github.com/uw-echospace/EchoPro/). Over time, the documentation for this package will be added here too.

The Jupyter notebooks are shown in a "rendered", executed form.

```{admonition} Glitches with some visualization elements
While the notebooks are rendered, there are some glitches we're still working out. In particular, some `ipywidgets` elements (especially in the semivariogram widget) don't display correctly, and some simple plots are not displaying at all.
```

Go to the individual example notebooks below or in the table of content on the left.
